Description: Pointing a laser at an aircraft poses a serious safety risk for all those on board. Although there has been a heightened awareness on the seriousness of these incidents, there has still been thousands of incidents reported each year. With 5,000+ being reported in 2016, 2017, 2018, & 2019, it is still evident that laser strikes remain a serious threat to aviation safety.
